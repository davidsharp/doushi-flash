## What?
A flashcard generator outputting Node Canvas images, leveraging [qubyte](https://qubyte.codes)'s [Japanese Conjugation quiz](https://japanese-conjugations.glitch.me/) for all the Japanese stuff. I'm also using code from a load of [my gists](https://gist.github.com/davidsharp), that use the `node-canvas` package to manipulate images.

## Why?
Because I wanted to hook up an IFTTT, to set these images as a phone background every so often, but also realised it's quite a nice tool to have access to generally.
